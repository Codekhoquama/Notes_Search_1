Computer generated kerberos events are always identifiable by the $ after the computer account's name. \n\r\nMicrosoft's Comments: \n\r\nThis event records that a Kerberos TGT was granted, actual access will not occur until a service ticket is granted, which is audited by Event 673.

Service tickets are obtained whenever a user or computer accesses a server on the network. For example, when a user maps a drive to a file server, the resulting service ticket request generates event ID\u00a04769 on the DC.",

Rather look at the\u00a0Account Information:\u00a0fields, which identify the user who logged on and the user account's DNS suffix. The User ID field provides the\u00a0SID of the account.\u00a0\n\r\nWindows logs other instances of event ID 4768 when a computer in the domain needs to authenticate to the DC typically when a workstation boots up or a server restarts.
